Arduino firmware to automatic magnetic stirrer  
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Requisites](#requirements)

## Getting Started
This project is to create your own cheap magnetic stirrer, because they are relatively expensive. Nobody wants to spend their money on a thing that is used just few time in a month.

## Requirements
You will need some microcontroller like Arduino and 3D printer
## Early Development
Stirrer is in the early phase development so i.e motor steering still needs an improvemends. Also i didn't publish case model to print because it still needs some polish.
